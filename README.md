IdahoBirdingTrail
=================

The Idaho Birding Trail (IBT) is a network of sites and side-trips that provides the best viewing opportunities to see birds in Idaho. With 175 sites and about 2,000 miles of trail, the birding trail represents a collection of bird watching hotspots, diverse habitats, and a glimpse of Idaho's rich natural heritage. Twenty-two sites are designated as Blue Ribbon sites. These are "the best of the best" bird viewing opportunities in Idaho.

A state House resolution in 2006 recognizes the Idaho Birding Trail as the official state birding trail. So enjoy the many feathered jewels of the Gem State, happy birding, and welcome!

This map was created through a combination of ArcGIS Online, ArcServer, and an Esri story map template.

The intital story map application template was downloaded from: http://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=36818676b74b453facef972ee5d90114

It was further customized to give it the IDFG look and feel and to add more functionality, such as the basemap picker.
